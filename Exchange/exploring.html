While abroad one of the great opportunities afforded you is the chance to travel in your host country.<br />
<br />
One of the pieces of advice that is always given is that if you can, find other students who are in your position as they will likely want to travel as well. It'll be safer, spread out the costs and may be more fun.<br/>
<br />
<br />
Madison is an awesome place to be based to go travelling, with its own airport and direct busses to Chicago International Airport for a larger range of destinations. <br />
<br />Destinations:
<br /><br />
<b>Chicago</b><br />
3-4 hours away from Madison sits Chicago, majestic as you approach by bus, with its skyline emerging dauntingly. Its a city full of culture, with its shoreline along lake Michigan this is one of the most happening areas with museums galore and the world famous bean art installation.
<br/><br />
<b>Milwaukee</b><br />
Madison may be the state capital of Wisconsin, but milwaukee is the largest city in the state. It sits right on the edge of Lake Michigan a couple of hours north of Chicago by car.<br />
Milwaukee is the home of the largest music festival in the world, Summerfest. It attracts hundreds of thousands of people over the 2 weeks and hosts some of the biggest names in the music industry. 
<br/><br />
<b>Boston</b> <br/>
In the harbour sits a museum adorned with british flags and docked onto it, a replica of the trade ship from which tea was thrown. This museum documents the events that led to the US declaring enough is enough when tea began being taxed by Britain.
Boston is home of the oldest Bar and the oldest resteraunt in the US, with Harvard and MIT just across the river in Cambridge and has a large and happening China Town.
<br/><br />
<b>Baltimore</b><br/>
One of the poorer major cities in the US, but steeped in history. Its harbour region is a very scenic area with a number of museums and an entertainment complex. My favourite place in Baltimore might have to be teavolve, a cafe near the harbour that served an inventive menu and the open mic scene attracted some very talented musicians.
<br/><br />
<b>LA</b><br/>
From the end of route 66 on the pier at Santa Monica, to Disneyland in Anaheim and to the sign that watches over the whole sprawling metropolis in Hollywood. LA has something for everyone, though it can be difficult to get from place to place, and coach tours usually don't spend any appreciable time at tourist spots, but if you can narrow down what to see and plan it well, LA is amazing!
<br/><br />
<b>Washington DC</b><br/>
I was lucky to be able to find someone willing to give me a tour of DC, otherwise 2 days would not have been enough!!<br />
Full of history, with monuments and memorials abounding, its an amazing look at American History. The best places to visit are the National Air and Space museum (though I might be biased) and the old post office, one of the tallest buildings in DC, it provides beautiful views of the Capital.
<br/><br />
<b>San Diego</b><br/>
This was maybe my favourite city that I was able to visit. It has a beautiful climate year round, is just the right size for a city, not too crowded, but has everything. The world famous zoo lives up to the hype, as long as you can make it there out of peak times. The beaches and waterfronts of San diego are amazingly pretty, with a very nice resteraunt district near the conference center (which hold comic con each year!!)
<br/><br />
<b>Austin</b><br/>
Like Madison, Austin is a college town, and so is much more of a liberal city than most other cities in Texas. Its main high street is home to an amzaing range of live music bars. It has a large number of parks and open spaces as well as being a big buisness and tech center. The only problem with Austin is that its suburbs stretch out for miles and miles, being Texas, there is just so much space. If you have access to a car though, then its a beautiful city to visit. PLease try going to a Salt Lick Resteraunt!
<br/><br />
<b>Denver</b><br/>
With The Rockies providing a jaw droppingly beautiful backdrop, you wind your way into Denver from the airport. its a relativly small city, but its suburbs spread out over a large area. We thought we could walk easily to one fo the national parks, it looked close on a map... It wasn`t. If you can make it while the national horse fair is going on, you can get a true glimpse of `country`.
<br/><br />
<b>Knoxville</b><br/>
I was in Knoxville for a grand total of 30 minutes, but an hours drive south brings you to Tellico Plains which is amazingly beautiful! with waterfalls, forests that stretch as far as you can see, mountain peaks dot the horizon, and the climate is perfect! Oh and if you have a motorcycle, its home to the road with the highest density of turns in the US and so in summer becomes a hub for biker clubs.
<br/><br />
Travelling during the christmas break is definitely recommended!! this period generally sees a dip in traveller numbers and as such a drop in the price of plane tickets, and if done in reasonable time, hostel prices are still cheap.
