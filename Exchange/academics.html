The Academic system here is very much different from in the UK, where we start straight away on our degree course and are very much restricted as to the modules we can take and are discouraged to do electives, here students don't decide on their final degree track until the end of second year, and can still switch later on if they have all the required classes, and its possible to double or even triple major.<br />
<br />
The Year is broken onto 2 semesters rather than 3 terms and each one is distinct, with it being rare to find classes that cover both semesters. They are 14 weeks in length with a week added on specifically for final exams and projects.<br />

The College of Engineering has a huge catalog to choose from and sets out its offerings in levels with a numbering system as follows:<br />
100-299 - intro undergraduate classes<br />
300-399 - 2nd and 3rd year intermediate undergraduate classes<br />
400-499 - 4th year undergraduate classes<br />
500-599 - advanced level undergraduate classes, taken sometimes by postgrads<br />
600-900 - postgraduate classes, most are research based, but can still be taken by adventurous undergrads<br /><br />

As academic advice first: I would say as long as you come close to covering a good portion of the required Warwick material for 3rd year, you should definitely take classes that are only offered here as it'll be the best place to explore subjects that may be in your perifary that you might find you are more interested in. Second: Don't be scared to go for those higher level 600 and 700 classes, you can always audit them so they don't affect your final GPA.<br />
third: If you can, if it is something you would like to do, try and make use of your ability to do academic training at the end of your exchange program, it might look good on your CV, but it will also let you experience the US in the summer, and maybe even Madison for that little bit longer.

As a reference here was my course list:<br />
E M A 521
Aerodynamics
<br />
E M A 542
Advanced Dynamics
<br />
E M A 601
Special Topics: Engr Mech (Topic: Rocket Propulsion)
<br />
M E 440
Intermediate Vibrations
<br />
M E 569
Applied Combustion
<br />
E M A 523
Flight Dynamics and Control
<br />
E M A 550
Astrodynamics
<br />
E M A 599
Independent Study ( Shock wave - Dual Bubble interaction)
<br />
E M A 642
Satellite Dynamics
<br />
M E 774
Chem Kinetics-Combust Sys
<br /><br />
EMA and Me refer to the partcular departments that offer these classes, EMA being Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics and ME being Mechanical Engineering
<br /><br />
Each class I took was 3 'credits', you have to take a minimum of 12 credits to keep up your Visa satus as a full time student.
<br /><br />
<b>Projects</b>
<br /><br />
A few of the classes provided projects as part of the assesment of the module, and the college of engineering has a host of student organisations that compete in regional, ntional and some international competitions.<br/>
The projects I took part in are shown here as a sample:<br /><br />
Theme park ride design and simulation (Advanced Dynamics)<br />
Rocket Nozzle design (roscket propulsion)<br />
Rocket design competition aiming for 30000ft (NASA competition)<br />
Moon mission and Uranus flyby orbit design (Astrodynmics) <br />
Satellite design for Geostationary circular orbit stability (Satellite dynamics)<br />
Aircraft Yaw Controller (Flight Dynamics and Control)<br />
Simulation of Shock Wave Bubble interactions (Independent study)<br />
<br />
Following on from that last one I was able to get a job as an assistant in the group I was doing the simulations for, and ended up over the summer running the physical version of what i'd been working on.
