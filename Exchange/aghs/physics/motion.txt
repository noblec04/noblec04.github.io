v=u+at

s=1/2(u+v)t

s=ut+1/2at^2

s=vt-1/2at^2

v^2=u^2+2as

a=(v-u)/t

s = the distance between initial and final positions (displacement) (sometimes denoted R or x)
u = the initial velocity (speed in a given direction)
v = the final velocity
a = the constant acceleration
t = the time taken to move from the initial state to the final state

acceleration due to force

F = ma,

y(x; t) = Acos(kx - wt) 

where the wave number k and angular frequency w are related to the wavelength and frequency/period

k =2pie/wavelength

w = 2pief

The speed of the wave is

v = wavelengthf or w = vk


E^2 = m^2 * c^4 + P^2 * c^2

zero mass

E = pc

relativistic mass

Mrel = Mrest/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)

photon momentum related to frequency

p = hf/c

photon momentum related to wavelength

p = h/wavelength

wavelength of a particle

wl = h/mv

energy of a photon

E = hf
